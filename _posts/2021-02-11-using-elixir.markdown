I have decided to expand and refocus this blog on learning [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) for awhile. I'm still using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate static HTML pages for this blog, but in order to consider the whole [JAM stack](https://jamstack.org/), some attention to server-side development is still needed.

## Functional Programming ##

You can find a lot of different functional programming languages out there.
OCmal, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, and Microsoft F# too. But why am I using Elixir?
It offers several features I'm hoping to use:
~~~
 concurrency (from Erlang)
 metaprogramming
 active community
 proven use cases

You might argue that these features are available in other languages, but after using Lisp and Prolog in years past, I feel most comfortable with the Elixir code I have already seen. The recently released versions of Elixir and the Phoenix web framework built with it seem to work really well together with PostgreSQL databases.

So, bought some online copies of books and started learning as much as possible during the last few weeks. I will mention two of these books right now. For learning Elixir the language, I'm reading the 2nd edition of **Elixir in Action** by Sa≈°a Juric, published 2019 by [Manning](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition). I'm also reading **Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix :Rethink the Modern Web App** by Lance Halvorsen, published 2018 by [Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/titles/lhelph/functional-web-development-with-elixir-otp-and-phoenix/). Both of these books complement each other fairly well, while
