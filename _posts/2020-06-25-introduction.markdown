When Leslie M. Orchard wrote "Hacking del.icio.us" in 2006 [^1],
the del.icio.us online bookmarking service was still a very
popular and vibrant social bookmarking site.

At first, how good was del.icio.us?
-----------------------------------
I will include quotes from this book while talking about what happened to del.icio.us and
the [pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in) bookmarking service available today.
The books introduction stated:

> Joshua Schachter invited me to try out del.icio.us in the latter half of 2003 (p. xv)

Until I read this book about using del.icio.us,
I just thought it was a weird domain name, but after trying del.icio.us
I agreed with the author's next quote.

> Joshua's clean and well-considered incremental improvements got me hooked (p. xv)

This book opened my eyes to what the so-called "Web 2.0" was about. I had
already done a lot of JavaScript programming
in order to improve the user interface experience for web sites.
But while reading the book,
I quickly learned so much more about open APIs, RSS and JSON feeds.

> Convenient bookmarklets, XML data feeds, and the del.icio.us API...made...
> the service frictionless -- and yet, counter-intuitively, these things
> made the site incredibly sticky. (p xv)

So, "Hacking del.icio.us" gave me a new appreciation for using
JSON to build dynamic web content based upon data supplied from dynamic
data feeds, as well as learning all about social bookmarking and how
'tags' can help groups of people organize information on the web.

> When Joshua introduced tagging features, the powers of social bookmarking really bloomed...
> del.icio.us morphed into a powerful hub for the aggregation and annotation
> of resources on the Web, filtered by the valuable attentions of real people. (p xv)

The book offered so much more:
* clear examples of using CSS to improve page presentation;
* concise, powerful examples of JavaScript using JSON feeds;
* server-side programming examples using PHP and Python;
* many different examples of integrating bookmarks into blogs;
* lots of ideas for mashups using other web services.

> del.icio.us...encouraged the growth of a rich ecosystem of Web- and
> desktop-based tools for managing, enhancing, and analyzing social bookmarks. (p xv)

Why del.icio.us disappeared
---------------------------

But alas, del.icio.us would not last. It's heyday has long since past. [^2]
Yahoo acquired del.icio.us in late 2005, and with the rise of mobile apps
and social sites like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube,
people moved on to other types of web experiences. These
users became the product that large corporations would fight to retain,
and a "social bookmark manager" did not seem to do well in this market.
This is the point that Yahoo never seemed to understand,
and perhaps mismanaged del.icio.us due to this misunderstanding.

Still, there were people who wanted to save bookmarks on the web, to
easily use and share those bookmarks in new and different ways. In 2009,
Maciej Cegłowski,[^3] a former Yahoo employee, started Pinboard [^4] because he
wanted to make "a bookmarking website for introverted people in a hurry." [^5]
In late 2010, when it leaked that Yahoo planned to "sunset" del.icio.us,
many users switched over to Pinboard.

Despite what Maciej claims, Pinboard isn't just "for introverts,"
it offers an API and RSS and JSON feeds just like del.icio.us used to,
and perhaps makes it easier to both share bookmarks and notes, as well
as allowing users to keep whatever they want private. It is a paid service,
which one could argue is actually better in the long run. Maciej says:

> Because Pinboard is fully supported by user payments,
> the site will never show ads, and I will never share user data with third parties.

Why I love Pinboard
-------------------

Pinboard is a very close fit for people who used del.icio.us way back when.
