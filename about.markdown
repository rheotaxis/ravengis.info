## Web Development Innovation ##

It's time to start using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/docs.html) and [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to develop new web projects using the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) (JavaScript, API, and Markup). This blog is an example of static HTML markup generated by the Jekyll. It includes some examples of client-side JavaScript that call web APIs for third party services like [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:rheotaxis/t:webdev) bookmarking site.

It's also possible to develop an API using Elixir and Phoenix, and that will be a focus here too.

## Who wants to know? ##

Anyone curious about implementing JAM stack projects using Elixir, Phoenix, Ecto for server side components, Jekyll for static client-side HTML, and JavaScript for both.

## Books ##

I will review books I like, and include my comments and attempts at using examples from these books.
