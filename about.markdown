##### Whom Is This Blog for? #####

I decided to write this blog for people like me,
that use **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)**
for making a blog, and want to include bookmarks from
**[pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in)**
as well as other types of JSON feeds. Along the way, I will try to incorporate some
of the examples from the book *Hacking del.icio.us* by Leslie M. Orchard, 2006,
adapted for **Pinboard** bookmark manager instead of **del.icio.us**.
