Whom Is This Blog for?

I decided to write this blog for people like me, that use Jekyll for making
a blog, and want to include bookmarks from pinboard.in as well as other
types of JSON feeds. It is my intention to build this blog using GitHub
public repository which is free for entry level users, and it supports
building blogs with Jekyll. Along the way, I will try to incorporate some
of the examples from the book "Hacking del.icio.us" by Leslie M. Orchard, 2006,
reworked for using pinboard.in bookmark manager.

There will be new information for 2020, because some of the tools and
concepts from 2006 no longer apply. At the time "Hacking del.icio.us"
was written, most open-source web development used the LAMP stack
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). Nowadays, there is a lot of attention
given to the JAM stack (Javascript, APIs, and Markup). Jekyll fits in
the JAM stack very well, producing static markup.
